# Predicting-Social-Media-Engagement-Using-Machine-Learning

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict the **number of social media shares** a post will receive based on its textual and categorical features. It combines **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation** into a unified workflow built in Python.

The project demonstrates how machine learning can drive **content strategy**, **targeting**, and **ROI improvement** in digital marketing by forecasting user engagement.
